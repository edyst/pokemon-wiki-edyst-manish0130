    <h2>What are Pocket Monsters?</h3>
      <p class="poke">Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and The
        Pokémon Company as part of the Pokémon media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from
        Ken Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy, and the main series of
        role-playing video games (RPGs), also referred as the "core series" by their developers

          <h2>Water</h2>
          <p>Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and Grass, which constitute the
            three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new
            players. Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based on a wide variety
            of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.

          <p>
            Fire is one of the three basic elemental types along with Water and Grass, which constitute the
            three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new
            players. Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so choosing the Fire
            variation starter is often a plus.

            three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new
            players.Grass is one of the weakest types statistically, with 5 defensive weaknesses and 7 types
            that are resistant to Grass moves.

        <p>The AR game's potential for weight loss was a big part of that discussion. In the process of getting
          out their doors and visiting parks, players found they were losing weight almost in spite of
          themselves. A Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for reporting that he'd lost 65 pounds between July
          and December.</p>

        <p>Pokémon GO is one of the most successful mobile games of all time, breaking records like fastest to
          earn $100 million and most-downloaded in its first month of release. To date, it has grossed almost
          $2 billion in revenue and been downloaded 800 million times. Although no longer the global
          phenomenon it was in 2016, the game remains incredibly popular.</p>

        compressed water. When it spins them and throws them at high speed, these stars can split metal in two."

        to wear a rag in order to look like Pikachu, everyone’s favorite Pokémon. Pokedex says: Its actual
        appearance is unknown. A scholar who saw what was under its rag was overwhelmed by terror and died from

    <h2>Q and A</h2>
    <h4>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer </h4>
    <ol>
      <li>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?
        <ul>
          <li> We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of
            Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's
            evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of
            generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild.
            Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.</li>
          <li>Answer is Raichu</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?
        <ul>
          <li>Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with,
            but progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild
            Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, you've
            reached the point where you're presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is
            a one shot catch, and no button mashing at all is required.
          </li>
          <li>Answer is Master Ball</li>

        <p>Pokémon Go's Types are exactly the same as those in the main Pokémon games, but the effect of those type matchups is slightly different: in brief, things like effective or resisted attacks have slightly different multipliers to the main
          Pokémon games - although a December 2018 update brought them slightly closer in line.</p>
